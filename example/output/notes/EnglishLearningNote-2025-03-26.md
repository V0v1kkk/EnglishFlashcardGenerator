Today we learned about conditionals.

**Zero conditional** - used for general truths
*If you heat water to 100Â°C, it boils.*

**First conditional** - used for possible future situations
*If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home.*

**Second conditional** - used for hypothetical or unlikely situations
*If I won the lottery, I would travel around the world.*

**Third conditional** - used for impossible past situations
*If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.*

**Mixed conditional** - combines different types
*If I had studied medicine (past), I would be a doctor now (present).*
