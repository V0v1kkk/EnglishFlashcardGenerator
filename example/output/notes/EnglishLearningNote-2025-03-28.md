Today we learned about phrasal verbs.

**look up** - to search for information in a reference book or database
*I looked up the word in the dictionary.*

**turn down** - to refuse or reject something
*She turned down the job offer because the salary was too low.*

**give up** - to stop trying to do something
*Don't give up on your dreams.*

**put off** - to postpone or delay
*We had to put off the meeting until next week.*

**get along with** - to have a good relationship with someone
*I get along with my colleagues very well.*

??? What's the difference between "put off" and "postpone"?
